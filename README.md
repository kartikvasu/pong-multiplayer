# Pong Multiplayer
A multiplayer pong game in the browser. I'm not much of a hacker... apologies for what you're about to see.      
My first project with socket.io. A simple pong game between two players that's mostly bouncing a ball around.   
Isn't that what all games are though? 

TODO:  
<ul>
  <li>Implement scaling stuff b/w back-end and front-end.</li>
  <li>Figure out player-opponent distinction stuff at front-end.</li>
  <li>More error checking at the front-end. Could think about throwing exceptions.</li>
  <li>Setup event controllers.
    <ul> 
    <li>Detect key events. </li> 
    <li>Emit socket events from the front-end.</li>
    <li>Detect socket events at the back-end.</li>
    <li>Update the entire game at the back-end.</li>
    <li>Push changes to players at the front-end.</li>
